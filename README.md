# house_prices
Small side project using ONS data on time series regional house prices (HPSSA dataset 37)


This projects acts as a demonstration of my Data Science skills and ability to write clean understandable code. The project aims to outline the
regional disparity in house prices, with relation to a number of metrics such as regional salary.

The project will be expanded to include some regression analyis through an r markdown aswell as use machine learning methods to predict house prices in the future.


### Clicking on Housing.ipynb should render an online jupyter markdown


## Objectives/Questions:

1. How have house prices responded to the 2008 financial collapse, and how has this effect been different across different parts of the country.
2. Where can you most quickly pay off a mortgage with relation to regional salary differences and median house prices?
3. Is the dramatic increase in house prices in London seen anywhere else?
4. Given Â£1,000,000, assuming all can be invested and sold every quater in any region, which pattern of buying and selling would have resulted in the maximum profit and how much profit is there?
5. See 4, but opposite - how quickly can all that money go to waste
