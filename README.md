# house_prices
Small side project using ONS data on time series regional house prices (HPSSA dataset 37)


This projects acts as a demonstration of my Data Science skills and ability to write clean understandable code. The project aims to outline the
regional disparity in house prices, with relation to a number of metrics such as regional salary.

The project will be expanded to include some regression analyis through an r markdown aswell as use machine learning methods to predict house prices in the future.
